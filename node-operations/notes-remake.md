### ABOUT
```
- The below are a compilation of notes that were taken while installing the preprod and mainnet dandeklion nodes.
- Some are basic, some not so much. If there was an issue it was noted.
- In the future I will play around with the formatting so that <br> it is more user friendly
- Tables will be inserted where it makes sense.
- These notes are as much for me as they are for YOU.
- All links were current at time of writing

# INSTALL LINUX
```
This section will contain all things Linux. From requirements, to utilities, to general and useful commands
```
<!--
1. [Download Linux ISO]()
2. [Create a bootable drive]()
3. [Utilities]()
4. [Terminal commands]()
	- [Updates & package management]()
	- [General]()
	- [Command flags]()
5. [Other Linux websites]()
-->

## DOWNLOAD LINUX ISO
```
It is recommended to only use LTS versions of Linux.
LTS means Long Term Support
```
| **LINUX TYPE**   |  **VERSION**  |  **LINK** | **DATE**  |
| ----             |    ------     |  -------- | -------   |
| Server [LTS]     | 24.04         | [click here](https://ubuntu.com/download/server/thank-you?version=24.04.2&architecture=amd64&lts=true)  | 12 April 2025 |
| Desktop [LTS]    | 24.04         | [click here](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop/thank-you?version=24.04.2&architecture=amd64&lts=true) | 12 April 2025 |

## CREATE A BOOTABLE DRIVE
- you can use a thumb-drive, usb-drive, external harddrive, SD-card or even a disc if your server and support system both have disc drives.
  ```
  ***NOTE*** 
  Any data on the media being used for this process will be wiped of data
  ```
  - `MacOS:` install [balenaEtcher](https://etcher.balena.io/) and follow instructions
  - `Windows:` install [UNetbootin](https://unetbootin.github.io/) and follow instructions
  - `Linux:` install [UNetbootin](https://unetbootin.github.io/) and follow instructions

## INSTALLING LINUX
```
THIS SECTION can be expanded upon
```
- boot to [bootable disk](https://github.com/st8tikratio/Uselessness/blob/main/node-operations/notes-remake.md#create-a-bootable-drive)
  ```
  you may need to hit one of the following at node-system boot in order to change the boot sequence or boot to the Linux media:
  - ESC
  - F2
  - F12
  - or similar
  there is typically a splash screen providing a BIOS/UEFI, Boot Order option
  ```
- click disc image in upper left-hand corner
  - follow instructions
  - when rebooting remove installation media
- initial boot may take some time depending on your system and specs

## FIRST THINGS FIRST
```
If node is already installed spin-down the docker containers:
  - docker compose down
```
### change swap file size
- from default (8GB) to 40G
    ```
    swapon --show
    sudo swapoff -v /swap.img 
    sudo rm -rf /swap.img
    sudo fallocate -l 40G /swap.img 
    sudo chmod 0600 /swap.img 
    sudo mkswap /swap.img 
    sudo swapon 
    sudo reboot now
    ```
### network & firewall

- This section is mostly for Desktop variants of Linux
- For Server variant commands and setup see pg.2 [HERE](https://github.com/st8tikratio/Uselessness/blob/main/node-operations/pdfs/Ubuntu-Server-CLI_cheat-sheet-2024-v6.pdf)

#### setup firewall
```
This install uses UFW, uncomplicated firewall
You may use any firewall you are comfortable with. 

*** NOTE ***
Your system could possibly become a target for hackers. It is important that you take all seurity precautions.
The guides within these pages are just that, guides, with no warranty implied or written.
Use at your own risk.
```

##### install GUFW - `graphical uncomplicated forewall`
```
sudo apt install gufw
```
- there should be a shield icon in programs or on desktop menu (Ubuntu Desktop only)
	1. Double-click UFW icon (shield with diagnol stripe)
	2. Turn firewall on, click slider
	3. Click on Rules
	4. Click on Simople
	5. Name: create a name for this rule, i.e. c-node
	6. Policy: Allow
	7. Direction: In
	8. Protocol: TCP
	9. Port or Service: 3001
	10. Click on Add
- REPEAT ABOVE for Haproxy on port 8053

#### terminal commands
- allows [port] for TCP
	```
	sudo ufw allow <port>/tcp
	```
- for more UFW commands go [HERE](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/xenial/man8/gufw.8.html)

#### communication ports
  
| **SERVICE**	|  **PORT**	| **STANDARD** 	| **DIRECTION**	| **SETTING LOCATION**	|

## TIPS, TRICKS, USEFUL CMDs
```
Some of these may require SUDO for full effectiveness

If output reads:
    - Command 'ipconfig' not found, did you mean:
You will need to install using:
    - sudo apt install [pkg name]

```

| **FUNCTION**  				| **CMD or ACTION** 				| 	**NOTES**										|
| --------------				 	| ----------				| -----------------										|
|   when typing in the CLI use `TAB` to autocomplete	| autocomplete <br> list options	| `./scripts/dand`   -> `TAB` key  â€”> `ENTER`							|
| `CTRL + S`						|pause large outputs			| may/may-not work on your particular output							|
| `CTRL + Q`						| resume large outputs			| if `CTRL + S` worked, this will resume the output						|
| `ip -br a`						| check network connectivity		| will show network device, ip address, and state						|
| `nmap` [your ip address from **ip -br a**]/24		| map a devices IP Address		| the `/24` may be different, see `ip -br a` output						|
| `sudo lshw -short` <br> `sudo lshw -h`		| show hardware devices			| shows list of all hardware <br> use CTRL+F to search within output				|
| `sudo lshw -json`					| shows hardware list in json format	| may want to save to file instead of screen output	|

### sensors
- more sensor information
  - **may/may-not** be applicable to dandelion node
  - ```
    from - https://www.hwinfo.com/forum/threads/cpu-temp-sensors-explanation.5597/
    -CPU (onboard sensor): This is either a temperature measured by a dedicated sensor on mainboard located inside the CPU socket (the external CPU temperature) or temperature obtained from internal CPU thermal sensor (i.e. DTS = Digital Thermal Sensor).
    -Core Max: The maximum temperature among all cores in the CPU.
    -CPU (Tctl): This is the T_control temperature available on AMD CPUs only. On several generations before Zen (Ryzen), this is not a reliable representation of the temperature. On AMD Zen series this is the temperature used to control cooling and is a fixed offset from the real CPU temperature. Offset is used mostly on X-series and some Threadripper CPUs; in such case two values are shown: Tctl and Tdie. If no offset is used, then only a single value is shown as Tctl/Tdie, which equals the real temperature.
    -CPU (Tdie): This value is shown in case the CPU uses an offset from Tctl and represents the real temperature (Tdie = Tctl - Tctl_offset).
    -CPU Package: Shown on Intel CPUs represents a 256-millisecond average value (calculated by CPU) of the hottest temperature sensor within the CPU package.
    -CPU Package (TSI): Available on pre-Zen AMD CPUs is the CPU temperature obtained via TSI interface.
    -Core #n (n=any number): Actual temperature of a particular CPU core.
    -CPU IA Cores: Maximum temperature among all computing (x86) cores in CPU (so part of CPU except Uncore and Graphics logic).
    -CPU GT Cores: Temperature of the integrated graphics part of CPU (if present).

### adding another drive to node build
- open fstab
  - ```
    sudo nano /etc/fstab
    ```
- copy primary drive information on newline and replace info with new drive info
	- last two digits on line should be 0 and 2
	- find UUID in `Drive Manager` (Linux Desktop 24.04 LTS)

### change root (main) drive to another drive of equal or greater size
- ***USE AT OWN RISK***
  ```
  THIS PROCESS NEEDS VERIFICATION
  
  	cd into drive to to be copied
	sudo mv [target location] ../../[target-drive]
		- use tab to insure correct path
	sudo nano etc/fstab
		- remove old directory path down to just /home
	reboot
	once logged delete old directory
  ```
  - swapping/reinstalling linux due to drive size
    - ```

## NON-NODE SYSTEM INSTALL (MONITORING SYS)
- pgadmin

---

## DOCKER INFOS
```
*** NOTE ***
You must navigate to the docker directory before executing the commands below
	- cd [path to docker container]
```
- docker uses project name as folder name
- possible to run multiple pre-prod instances with different variables being entered into `.env` in global variable
  - must not conflict; cannot have two that are both 0, 0; must be 0, 1 **OR** 0, 2

### autostart
```
VALIDITY ???
You should set 'KillUserProcesses=no' on '/etc/systemd/logind.conf' and run 'systemctl restart systemd-logind'
```

### commands

| **COMMAND**			| **USE**					| **NOTES**												|

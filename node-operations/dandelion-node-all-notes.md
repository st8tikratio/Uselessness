## DANDELION

### general dandelion syncing specs
- **Uptime: 2 days, 0:41:56**
  - ```  
    27.4% swap space; of 40G swap space
    45.3% of memory: of 128G
    25.3% CPU; 16-Core
    682G of drive space; of 1 TB
    22.8ms max CPU_IOWAIT by postgres, postgres, postgres
    ```
### swap file resizing
- change swap file size from 8G to 40G
  - use `docker compose down` if applicable
  - ```
    swapon --show
    sudo swapoff -v /swap.img 
    sudo rm -rf /swap.img
    sudo fallocate -l 40G /swap.img 
    sudo chmod 0600 /swap.img 
    sudo mkswap /swap.img 
    sudo swapon 
    sudo reboot now
    ```

## TIPS, TRICKS, USEFUL CMDs

### install git
- install git
  - ```
    sudo apt install git
    ```

### autocomplete using TAB
- start typing path or directory and hit `TAB` to autcomplete
  - if not autocomplete, hit `TAB` twice for list of 'paths'
  - example
    ```
    ./scripts/dand   -> TAB key  â€”> ENTER
    ```

### general linux commands
- get help for any command
  - ```
    [your command] -h
    ```
    **OR**
    ```
    [your command] --help
    ```
- check to see if an application or package is install
  - ```
    which [app or package name]
    ```
- check version of application or package
  - ```
    [app or package name] -v
    ```
    **OR**
    ```
    [app or package name] --version
    ```
- use this to pause (and resume) large outputs
  - pausing
    - ```
      CTRL + S
      ```
  - resume
    - ```
      CTRL + Q
      ```
- update or upgrade system and applications
  - ```
    sudo apt uodate
    ```
  - THEN
  - ```
    sudo apt upgrade
    ```

### inline file editor
- this is for nano
  - ```
    which nano
    ```
  - **IF NOT OUTPUT**
    ```
    sudo apt install nano
    ```
- VIM is another inline editor

### networking
- check if any `connection` is active
  - ```
    ip -br a
    ```
- check `network map`
  - ```
    namp [your IP addess from (ip -br a)]/24
    ```   

### filesysten information
- to see drive info including usage
  - ```
    df -h
    ```

### adding another drive to node build
- open fstab
  - ```
    sudo nano /etc/fstab
    ```
- copy primary drive information on newline and replace info with new drive info
	- last two digits on line should be 0 and 2
	- find UUID in `Drive Manager` (Linux Desktop 24.04 LTS)

### copy permissions when copying/swapping data across directories or disk
- add this to the larger cli entry
  - ```
    cp -p
    ```

### onboard sensors
- provides insight into system specific temperatures and resource usage
- check if sensors is install
  - ```
    which lm-sensors
    ```
- if nothing returned
  - ```
    sudo apt install lm-sensors
    ```
- to monitor, display and update sensors at 1 second intervals
  - ```
    sudo watch -n 1 -d sensors
    ```
  - change the `1` to any number to monitor for that interval period
    - ```
      i.e. changing `1` to a `5` will change refresh interval to 5 seconds
      ```
- more sensor information
  - **may/may-not** be applicable to dandelion node
  - ```
    from - https://www.hwinfo.com/forum/threads/cpu-temp-sensors-explanation.5597/
    -CPU (onboard sensor): This is either a temperature measured by a dedicated sensor on mainboard located inside the CPU socket (the external CPU temperature) or temperature obtained from internal CPU thermal sensor (i.e. DTS = Digital Thermal Sensor).
    -Core Max: The maximum temperature among all cores in the CPU.
    -CPU (Tctl): This is the T_control temperature available on AMD CPUs only. On several generations before Zen (Ryzen), this is not a reliable representation of the temperature. On AMD Zen series this is the temperature used to control cooling and is a fixed offset from the real CPU temperature. Offset is used mostly on X-series and some Threadripper CPUs; in such case two values are shown: Tctl and Tdie. If no offset is used, then only a single value is shown as Tctl/Tdie, which equals the real temperature.
    -CPU (Tdie): This value is shown in case the CPU uses an offset from Tctl and represents the real temperature (Tdie = Tctl - Tctl_offset).
    -CPU Package: Shown on Intel CPUs represents a 256-millisecond average value (calculated by CPU) of the hottest temperature sensor within the CPU package.
    -CPU Package (TSI): Available on pre-Zen AMD CPUs is the CPU temperature obtained via TSI interface.
    -Core #n (n=any number): Actual temperature of a particular CPU core.
    -CPU IA Cores: Maximum temperature among all computing (x86) cores in CPU (so part of CPU except Uncore and Graphics logic).
    -CPU GT Cores: Temperature of the integrated graphics part of CPU (if present).
    ```

    ```

    
### get hardware identifiers
- LSHW
  - check identifiers for driver updates or other troubleshooting
    - ```
      sudo lshw -short
      ```
  - output should provide information needed
    - use `CTRL + F` toi perform a keyword search on the output
  - can use `-json` or `-html` to get info in particular formats
 
### system overview

- INXI
  - overall system view, neatly organized, more user friendly
    - ```
      which inxi
      ```
	- if no output
    - ```
      sudo apt install inxi
      ```
  - to see system specs, hw names, drivers (user-friendly view)
    - ```
      sudo inxi -Fxz
      ```
- GLANCES
  - system overview with active processes
  - great for monitoring remotely
  - install Glances
    - ```
      sudo apt install glances
      ```
  - THEN
    - ```
      sudo glances
      ```

### change root (main) drive to another drive of equal or greater size
- ***use at own risk***
  - swapping/reinstalling linux due to drive size
    - ```
      https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2471454&p=14078689#post14078689
      ```
  - change boot volume with copying
    - ```

## NON-NODE SYSTEM INSTALL (MONITORING SYS)
- pgadmin

---

## DOCKER
- docker uses project name as folder name
- possible to run multiple pre-prod instances with different variables being entered into `.env` in global variable
  - must not conflict; cannot have two that are both 0, 0; must be 0, 1 **OR** 0, 2

### stop & resume docker processes
- navigate to docker directory
  - ```
    cd /home/[username]/.../[directory with docker container] 
    ```
- stop docker process
  - ```
    docker compose down
    ```
- resume docker process
  - ```
    docker compose up
    ```

      - internet claims this is the wifi NIC
	- specific linux github directory
    - ```
      https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/drivers/net/wireless/realtek/rtw89/rtw8922ae.c
      ```
  - PID (???)
    - ```
      10EC:8922
      ```
  - might need to `re-ENABLE` onboard NIC in BIOS to see in `lshw`

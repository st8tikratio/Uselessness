### ROGUE PROCESS (postgresdb)
- now sitting at 1.33TB on `home`, then right back to 1.31TB within seconds
- it is `dandolite-mainnet_postgresdb` causing the exceptional disk usage

#### REMOVING EXISTING CONTAINER AND RE-IMPLEMENTING
remove postgresdb container
```
cd [your path to dandelion-lite mainnet]

eample:
cd services/dandelion-lite
```
```
docker compose down
```
```
./scripts/docker/list-volume-sizes.sh
```
```
docker volume rm /dandolite-mainnet_postgresdb
```
```
docker compose up
```
check that container is gone
```
./scripts/docker/list-volume-sizes.sh
```
re-initialize postgres
```
scripts/dandoman.sh
```
```
select Docker
```
```
select Docker Status
```
make sure all things show up
- if not, wait or check back later

```
select BACK
```
```
select SETUP
```
```
select INTIALIZE POSTGRES
```

### Docker Volume Sizes
- checked `docker volume sizes` using
```
./scripts/docker/list-volume-sizes.sh
```
- output
<img width="899" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be9dbcaa-630a-4305-9228-3345ea978627" />

### ~~Docker's False Positive~~
#### **LATER TOLD THE OUTPUT FROM THE BELOW IS NOT ACCURATE**
```
- navigated to both:
  cd services/dandelione-lite
  cd services/dandelion-lite-preprod
and executed
  scripts/dandoman.sh
```

### Glances (Sys Overview)
- `home` dropped to `1.30T` then quickly jumped to `1.31T`
- `glances` output below

###### 13 APRIL 2025
## Pre-shutdown
- Primary drive sitting at `1.33 TB`
- CPU usage `very high`
- Uptime is `< 36 hours`
- There are four instances of:
  ```
  /bin/sh -c echo ...
  
  These are associated with ogmios and port 1337 and vary in CPU usage over time.
  ```

## Post-shutdown
- Primary drive now at `1.30 TB`
- Brave usage is `weird and high`, it appears
- Guess is `THE PROCESSES BELOW` are associated with the Desktop version of Ubuntu and not present in Server
- Researching ways to kill or remove the following processes
